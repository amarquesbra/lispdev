Cusp is an IDE for programming in lisp (Common Lisp flavor).
It comes prepackaged with <link sbcl> and a set of tested libraries. 
Its package contains everything for it to work and cusp doesn't have any
external dependencies (other than Eclipse).
Cusp contains all the basic features you expect from mordern IDE and some more:
code formatting and coloring, folding, outline, autocompletion proposals,
hover quickhelp, argument tips, jump to definition, project wizard,
integrated testing, library management, code context sensitive help, debugger.
